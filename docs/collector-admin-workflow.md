# Collector â†’ Admin Payment Workflow

## Overview
This document explains the complete workflow from when a collector accepts a waste request to when the admin processes payment for the collector.

## Workflow Steps

### 1. User Submits Waste Request
- User creates waste submission via WasteSubmission page
- Status: `requested`
- Available for collectors to accept

### 2. Collector Accepts Request
- Collector sees request in "Pickup Requests" section
- Clicks "Accept Request" button
- Backend: `assignCollector` function is called
- Status changes: `requested` â†’ `scheduled`
- User receives EcoTokens immediately
- Collection appears in collector's "Current Work" section

### 3. Collector Starts Pickup
- Collector sees collection in "Today's Schedule" or "Current Work"
- Clicks "ðŸš€ Start Pickup" button
- Status changes: `scheduled` â†’ `in_progress`

### 4. Collector Collects Waste
- Collector clicks "âœ… Collect Waste" button
- Backend: `markAsCollected` function is called
- Status changes: `in_progress` â†’ `collected`
- Collection now appears in admin dashboard for payment processing

### 5. Admin Processes Payment
- Admin sees collection in "Collector Payments" section
- System suggests payment (30% of user tokens earned)
- Admin clicks "Process Payment"
- Backend: `processCollectorPayment` function is called
- Collector receives payment tokens
- Status changes: `collected` â†’ `delivered`
- Collection removed from admin payment queue

## Key Files

### Backend
- `controllers/garbageCollectionController.js` - assignCollector, markAsCollected
- `controllers/adminController.js` - getCollectionsForPayment, processCollectorPayment
- `database/models/GarbageCollection.js` - Schema with payment field
- `routes/garbageCollectionRoutes.js` - Collector endpoints
- `routes/adminRoutes.js` - Admin endpoints

### Frontend
- `pages/CollectorDashboard.tsx` - Collector interface
- `pages/AdminDashboard.tsx` - Admin payment processing
- `services/wasteService.ts` - Collector API calls
- `services/adminService.ts` - Admin API calls

## Database Schema

### GarbageCollection.payment
```javascript
payment: {
  collectorPaid: { type: Boolean, default: false },
  collectorPaymentAmount: { type: Number },
  collectorPaymentDate: { type: Date },
  collectorPaymentMethod: { type: String },
  adminNotes: { type: String }
}
```

## API Endpoints

### Collector Endpoints
- `POST /api/collections/:collectionId/assign` - Accept request
- `POST /api/collections/:collectionId/collected` - Mark as collected
- `PUT /api/collections/:collectionId/status` - Update status
- `GET /api/collections?assignedToMe=true` - Get assigned collections

### Admin Endpoints
- `GET /api/admin/collections/payment-pending` - Get collections ready for payment
- `POST /api/admin/collections/:collectionId/pay-collector` - Process payment
- `GET /api/admin/stats` - Get dashboard statistics

## Status Flow
```
requested â†’ scheduled â†’ in_progress â†’ collected â†’ delivered â†’ verified â†’ completed
              â†‘            â†‘            â†‘         â†‘
        collector    collector    collector   admin
        accepts      starts       collects    pays
```

## Testing the Workflow

### Prerequisites
1. Backend server running on port 4000
2. Frontend running on port 3000
3. MongoDB connected
4. At least one user, collector, and admin account

### Test Steps
1. **Create waste request** (as user)
2. **Accept request** (as collector) - should appear in Current Work
3. **Start pickup** (as collector) - status â†’ in_progress
4. **Mark collected** (as collector) - status â†’ collected
5. **Process payment** (as admin) - should appear in Collector Payments section

### Debugging
- Check browser console for API calls and responses
- Check server logs for backend processing
- Use the test script: `node test-collector-workflow.js`

## Common Issues

### Collections Not Showing in Collector Dashboard
- Check if `getMyAssignedCollections` API is working
- Verify `assignedToMe=true` parameter is being sent
- Check collector authentication

### Collections Not Showing in Admin Dashboard
- Verify collections have status `collected`
- Check that `payment.collectorPaid` is not `true`
- Ensure admin authentication is working

### Payment Processing Fails
- Check if collection exists and has correct status
- Verify admin has proper permissions
- Check if collector exists and can receive tokens

## Success Indicators
âœ… User receives tokens when collector accepts
âœ… Collector sees accepted collections in Current Work
âœ… Status updates work correctly
âœ… Collected items appear in admin dashboard
âœ… Admin can process payments successfully
âœ… Collector receives payment tokens
