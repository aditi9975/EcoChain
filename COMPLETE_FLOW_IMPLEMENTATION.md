## Flow Description

### 1. Product Browsing
- Users browse products on the Marketplace page
- Products display price in both rupees and EcoTokens
- Users can add products to cart directly from this page

### 2. Cart Management
- Users can view their cart by clicking "View Cart" button
- On the Cart page, users can:
  - Adjust quantities of items
  - Remove items from cart
  - See order summary with totals
  - Proceed to checkout or continue shopping

### 3. Checkout Process
- Users enter shipping information
- Users select payment method:
  - EcoTokens: Deducts tokens from user's wallet
  - Cash on Delivery: No immediate payment
  - Credit/Debit Card: (Future implementation)
- Users review order details before placing order

### 4. Order Creation
- System validates product availability and stock
- Calculates order totals including taxes and shipping
- For token payments:
  - Deducts appropriate number of tokens from user's wallet
  - Creates transaction record
- Updates product inventory
- Generates unique order ID and tracking number

### 5. Order Confirmation
- Users are redirected to order confirmation page
- Page displays order details including:
  - Order number
  - Items purchased
  - Shipping information
  - Payment method used
  - Total amount paid

### 6. Order Tracking
- Users can track order status from confirmation page or dashboard
- Tracking page shows:
  - Current order status (placed, confirmed, processing, shipped, delivered)
  - Shipping information
  - Estimated delivery date
  - Order history timeline

## Payment Methods

### EcoTokens
- 1 EcoToken = â‚¹0.1 (configurable)
- Tokens are deducted from user's wallet balance
- Transaction records are created for all token usage
- Tokens are refunded if order is cancelled

### Cash on Delivery
- No immediate payment processing
- Payment collected at time of delivery

### Credit/Debit Card
- (Future implementation)

## Error Handling

### Insufficient Stock
- System checks product availability before order creation
- Returns error if requested quantity exceeds available stock

### Insufficient EcoTokens
- System checks user's token balance before order creation
- Automatically adjusts token usage if balance is insufficient

### Order Cancellation
- Users can cancel orders in "placed" or "confirmed" status
- EcoTokens are refunded to user's wallet
- Transaction records are created for refunds

## Testing

The implementation has been tested for:

- Placing orders with different payment methods
- Tracking order status
- Handling error conditions

## Future Improvements

1. Implement credit/debit card payment processing
2. Add order modification functionality
3. Enhance order tracking with real-time updates
